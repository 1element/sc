## Contributing

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute to Surveillance Center.

There are many ways to contribute. For example, you might improve the 
documentation, add new i18n translations, submit bug reports and 
feature requests or write code.

Here is a quick guide how to submit pull requests:

1. Fork the project on GitHub and check out your copy locally.

2. For developing new features and bug fixes, the `develop` branch should be 
pulled and built upon.

3. Commit your changes and push to your fork.

4. Go to GitHub and [create a pull request](https://github.com/1element/sc/compare)
